# CheckingPositiveOrNegativeNumbers
There are programs that does not work or prints out an error message when a negative number is entered as an answer, so my code simply just checks whether a number is positive or negative. Basically, it asks you to enter a number, then reads the number. If the number you entered is less than 0 then it prints out "The number is negative" , if the number you entered is greater than 0 then it prints out "The number is positive" and if the number you entered is 0 then it prints out "The number is 0".
